# CLAUDE.md — IBISWorld Sales Dashboard
*For Claude Code sessions. Read this before touching any code.*

---

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
Single-file sales intelligence dashboard for Dan Starr, BDM at IBISWorld (US Major Markets).
Built as a personal productivity tool — NOT an official IBISWorld product.

**Live URL:** https://dabbs4dan.github.io/ibisworld-dashboard
**Repo:** github.com/Dabbs4Dan/ibisworld-dashboard (public, main branch)
**File:** `index.html` — single self-contained file, ~1,600+ lines

---

## DEPLOY WORKFLOW
Claude Code edits `index.html` locally → Dan runs:
```
git add index.html
git commit -m "description of change"
git push
```
GitHub Pages auto-deploys in ~30 seconds. That's it.

---

## ARCHITECTURE — CRITICAL RULES
- **Single file only** — everything lives in `index.html` (HTML + CSS + JS, no separate files)
- **No build tools, no npm, no frameworks** — vanilla JS only
- **No external dependencies** except Google Fonts + DuckDuckGo favicon API
- **localStorage** for persistence — four keys, all in one logical namespace:
  - `ibis_accounts` → raw account rows from the SF CSV
  - `ibis_local` → flags, notes, **and revenue cache** (per-account, keyed by Account Name)
  - `ibis_licenses` → slim decoded license rows
  - `ibis_updated` → date string of last accounts CSV upload
  - ⚠️ There is **no separate `ibis_revenue` key** — revenue lives inside `ibis_local`
  - `checkStorageSize()` fires on `init()` and after both CSV uploads; logs a console warning if any key exceeds 2MB or total exceeds 4MB
- All CSV parsing happens client-side in the browser

---

## CURRENT STATE — v20 (stable)

  - 🟢 International (`- AU -`, `- UK -`, etc.)
  - 🟣 Trial (contains "Trial")
  - ⚫ Migration → **always hidden** ($0 junk rows)
- Status bucketing by License End Date vs today:
  - ✅ Active (end date in future)

## CSV SCHEMAS

### Accounts CSV (SF "DA$ Account Stalker" report)
IBISWorld Custom Report Title, # Core Clients, # Core Opportunities,
US Days Since Last Activity, Account Name, Website, Major Markets Tier,
Vertical, Sub-Vertical, Employees, Annual Revenue Currency, Annual Revenue,
6sense Account Intent Score NA, 6sense Account Buying Stage NA

### License CSV (SF "Account with Licenses & Products" report)
Account Name, License Name, Opportunity Name,
Annualized Amount Currency, Annualized Amount,
License Start Date, License End Date

---

## BUSINESS LOGIC — CRITICAL
- IBISWorld does **NOT** sell by seat count
- In Dan's territory, active licenses are always **PIQ or International** — never US Industry
- **US Industry = churn signal**, not active client
- The Salesforce "Active License" field is **unreliable** — always use License End Date comparison vs today
- Account name matching uses case-insensitive trim (`normName()`)

## HOW TO WORK WITH DAN

### Who Dan is
- Non-technical vibe coder — explain everything in plain English, no jargon
- Visual thinker — use emojis, tables, short bullets, never walls of text
- Moves fast — values speed and iteration over perfection

### How to communicate
- Before ANY change: one sentence explaining what you're about to do and why
- After ANY change: bullet list of exactly what changed, confirmed push, and what's next
- If something is broken or risky: flag it immediately with 🚨 before touching anything
- Max one logical change group at a time — always pause and summarize before moving on

### How to handle bugs & polish
- Small bugs and style fixes: just fix them, explain after, then push
- Anything that touches core logic or adds a new feature: propose a plan first, wait for Dan to say "go"
- If you're unsure what Dan wants: ask ONE specific question before proceeding

### Git workflow
- Always commit and push after every completed task
- Commit messages should be short and plain English (not technical)
- Always confirm: commit hash + "live in ~30 seconds"

### Vibe check
- Dan should always feel like he knows what's happening
- If the dashboard looks worse after a change, that's a failure — visual quality always matters
- When in doubt: simpler, cleaner, faster

## SESSION & CONTEXT MANAGEMENT

### Starting fresh — do this first
When a new session begins, Claude Code should:
1. Read CLAUDE.md fully
2. Confirm in one line: current version, last thing built, next open item
3. Ask Dan: "What do you want to tackle?"
- Never assume Dan remembers where things left off — he shouldn't have to

### Context window health
- After ~15 back-and-forth exchanges, say proactively:
  > 🧠 "Heads up — this session is getting long. Type `/compact` to compress history, or start a fresh window. CLAUDE.md has everything needed to pick up instantly."
- If responses feel repetitive or confused, flag it immediately — don't silently degrade

### Before closing a window — always confirm
- ✅ All changes committed and pushed to main
- ✅ CLAUDE.md reflects current state of the codebase
- ✅ Any unfinished work is noted below under Open Items
