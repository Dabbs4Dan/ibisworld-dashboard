# CLAUDE.md — IBISWorld Sales Dashboard
*For Claude Code sessions. Read this before touching any code.*

---

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
Single-file sales intelligence dashboard for Dan Starr, BDM at IBISWorld (US Major Markets).
Built as a personal productivity tool — NOT an official IBISWorld product.

**Live URL:** https://dabbs4dan.github.io/ibisworld-dashboard
**Repo:** github.com/Dabbs4Dan/ibisworld-dashboard (public, main branch)
**File:** `index.html` — single self-contained file, ~3,980+ lines

---

## DEPLOY WORKFLOW
Claude Code edits `index.html` locally → Dan runs:
```
git add index.html
git commit -m "description of change"
git push
```
GitHub Pages auto-deploys in ~30 seconds. That's it.

---

## ARCHITECTURE — CRITICAL RULES
- **Single file only** — everything lives in `index.html` (HTML + CSS + JS, no separate files)
- **No build tools, no npm, no frameworks** — vanilla JS only
- **No external dependencies** except Google Fonts + DuckDuckGo favicon API
- **localStorage** for persistence — four keys, all in one logical namespace:
  - `ibis_accounts` → raw account rows from the SF CSV
  - `ibis_local` → flags, notes, revenue cache, **and `_lastSeen` date** (per-account, keyed by Account Name)
  - `ibis_licenses` → slim decoded license rows
  - `ibis_updated` → date string of last accounts CSV upload
  - ⚠️ There is **no separate `ibis_revenue` key** — revenue lives inside `ibis_local`
  - `ibis_opps` → contact pipeline rows, keyed by email (lowercase trimmed)
  - `ibis_dead` → dead accounts array + dead licenses array (`{ accounts: [...], licenses: [...] }`). Accounts added when missing from re-upload CSV; their licenses are **auto-moved to dead at the same time** (no separate license re-upload needed). Licenses also move independently when missing from license CSV re-upload. Each dead account carries `_deadSince`, `_statusAtDeath`, `_unexpectedDrop`, `_localSnapshot`.
  - `checkStorageSize()` fires on `init()` and after both CSV uploads; logs a console warning if any key exceeds 2MB or total exceeds 4MB
- All CSV parsing happens client-side in the browser

---

## CURRENT STATE — v25 (stable)

### Four tabs live:
1. **📋 Accounts tab** — main territory view
2. **🔑 Licenses tab** — churn/active license data (renamed from "License Intelligence")
3. **🎯 Workables tab** — contact pipeline with Cards + Table view
4. **💀 Dead tab** — accounts/licenses that have disappeared from CSV uploads

### Accounts Tab Features
- SF CSV upload → instant dashboard population
- Change detection → 🆕 flags new accounts
- Cards + Table view toggle
- Custom colored vertical dropdown
- Revenue column with auto-enrichment + progress indicator (bottom-right spinner)
- Logo cascade: UpLead → DuckDuckGo → Google Favicon → Initials
- Accounts CSV button turns ✅ green when freshly uploaded this session
- 6sense buying stage badges
- 🗑️ clear buttons next to each CSV upload — accounts clears `ibis_accounts`+`ibis_updated` only (preserves `ibis_local`); licenses clears `ibis_licenses` only
- **Row click modal removed** — clicking a row no longer opens the flags/notes/revenue modal (removed `onclick="openModal(...)"` from `<tr>` and `.account-card`)

#### Accounts Table Columns (left → right)
Status | Company | Vertical | Tier | Revenue | Score | Workables | US Client | Active Client | Opps | Licenses | Stage | Intent | Days Inactive

#### Status Column (new in v23)
- Per-account dropdown: **✓ Keep** (green), **👁 Monitor** (yellow), **✗ Drop** (red), **— ** (grey dash)
- Stored in `ibis_local[name].acctStatus` — persists across CSV uploads; `pruneStaleLocalData` treats `acctStatus` as user data (won't prune)
- **Portal dropdown** — menu rendered in `<div id="acct-status-portal">` at `<body>` level (NOT inside the table), `z-index:9500`. Avoids all table stacking context / click-through issues permanently. `openAcctStatusPortal(id, triggerBtn)` positions portal via `getBoundingClientRect()`. `applyPortalStatus(status)` recovers account name by reverse-matching the wrap ID against `accounts[]` — no JS string escaping needed
- In-place trigger update on selection (no `renderAll()` call) — selection is instant, row order never changes
- Closes on click-outside and on scroll
- **Collapsible column** — toggle button (`‹`/`›`) is a visible grey pill in the `<th>`. Collapsed state shrinks to 28px strip (not zero) showing only the expand button; `td` cells get `background:#f9fafb` as visual cue. `<span class="status-col-label">` wraps text so it hides independently from the button. CSS class `table.status-col-collapsed` controls all collapsed states.

#### Priority Column (new in v26)
- Per-account dropdown with 5 rarity tiers (Minecraft-style item rarity):
  - 💎 **Legendary** (gold) · ⭐ **Very Rare** (purple) · 🔨 **Rare** (blue) · ⛏ **Uncommon** (green) · 🪵 **Common** (grey) · dash (unset)
- Stored in `ibis_local[name].acctPriority` — same prune protection as `acctStatus`
- **Portal dropdown** — `<div id="acct-priority-portal">` at `<body>` level, `z-index:9501`. Same architecture as status portal. `openAcctPriorityPortal(id, triggerBtn)` / `applyPortalPriority(prio)` mirror status pattern exactly.
- Filter chips: 💎 Legendary · ⭐ Very Rare · 🔨 Rare · ⛏ Uncommon in the top filter bar
- Sortable column; `acctPriority` added to `ACCT_SORT_DEFAULT_DIR`

#### Workables Column (new in v23)
- Purple circle `<span class="wkbl-dot">` with count of non-archived entries in `ibis_opps` matching the account name
- `getWorkableCount(name)` uses `normName()` matching — grey dash if 0

#### US Client Column (new in v23)
- Green ✓ checkmark if account has ANY US Industry license in `ibis_licenses` (regardless of active/churn status)
- `hasUSLicense(name)` — grey dash if none

#### Active Client Column (new in v23)
- Shows **only active PIQ or INTL** license badges borrowed from Licenses tab
- `getActiveLicBadges(name)` — returns coloured badge spans or empty string
- Grey dash if no active license — renamed from "Licenses" to "Active Client"

#### Filter Chips (v23 — replaced old Hot/Opp/Winback/Watching set; updated v26)
- ✓ Keep · 👁 Monitor · ✗ Drop · 🟢 Active License · 💎 Legendary · ⭐ Very Rare · 🔨 Rare · ⛏ Uncommon
- **OR-within-group / AND-between-group logic** (v26): chips in the same category are OR; chips from different categories are AND
  - e.g. Legendary + Very Rare = shows **either** (previously showed nothing)
  - e.g. Keep + Legendary = shows Keep accounts that are **also** Legendary
- Groups: Status (KEEP/MONITOR/DROP), Priority (PRIO_*), Stage (STAGE_*), Standalone (ACTIVE_LIC)
- `toggleChip(el, flag)` toggles individual flags; `renderAll()` re-evaluates all group logic on each filter change

#### Stage Filter (new in v26)
- Every 6sense Buying Stage badge in the accounts table AND card view is now clickable
- Click a badge → adds `STAGE_[value]` to `activeFlags`, filters to only that stage; outline ring appears on active badge
- Click same badge again → clears that stage filter
- Multiple stage badges can be active simultaneously (OR logic — same group mechanism as priority chips)
- `toggleStageFilter(stageVal)` — adds/removes `'STAGE_'+stageVal` key from `activeFlags`
- CSS: `.stage-tag.stage-clickable` (cursor), `.stage-tag.stage-active` (outline ring + offset)

#### Tier Filter Dropdown (new in v23)
- Multi-select checkbox dropdown on the Tier column header (matches license tab filter pattern)
- Options: T1, T2, T3, T4, — (no tier). AND logic with other filters
- State: `acctTierFilters` (Set). `applyTierFilter()` / `clearTierFilter()`

#### Sentiment Score Column (new in v24)
- Weighted 1–10 composite score per account, displayed as clickable color-coded badge (green 8–10, amber 5–7, red 1–4, grey dash for null)
- Trend arrow (↑/→/↓) based on composite of 5 signal types: Wikidata revenue history, Wikipedia growth/distress keywords, engagement recency, license status
- **Battle card popover** — click score badge to see: large score ring, auto-generated headline, trend + confidence indicators, 6 weighted factor bars
- Portal pattern (`#sentiment-card`, z-index:9600) — same architecture as status dropdown. Closes on click-outside + scroll.
- **Data sources** — NO paid API needed. Uses same free Wikipedia + Wikidata APIs as descriptions:
  - Wikidata entity claims: revenue history (P2139), employees (P1128), stock exchange (P414), dissolved (P576), acquired (P1366)
  - Wikipedia extract: keyword-scanned for growth/distress/acquisition signals
  - Internal data: revenue size, 6sense intent + stage, days inactive, workables count, opps count, license status
- **6 scoring factors**: Scale (15%), Rev Trend (20%), Mkt Signals (20%), Engagement (20%), Pipeline (15%), Licenses (10%)
- Enrichment queue: `sentQueue[]` / `runSentQueue()` — runs alongside description queue, triggered on init + CSV upload. `SENT_VERSION` bump forces re-score.
- Stored in `ibis_local[name].sentiment` — `{score, headline, rationale, trend, confidence, factors:{...}, v}`
- Sortable column, nulls sort last (-1). Added to `ACCT_SORT_DEFAULT_DIR`, sort dropdown, sort arrows.
- Card view: Score stat-cell between Tier and Intent
- `cloudflare-worker.js` in repo — optional Cloudflare Worker proxy for future Claude API enrichment (not currently used for scoring)

#### Frozen Sort Order (new in v23)
- After any explicit sort (column header click), row order is locked into `frozenSortOrder[]`
- All subsequent `renderAll()` calls (background enrichment, status changes, filter changes) preserve the frozen order — rows never shuffle mid-session
- Lock clears ONLY when user clicks a column header again (`setSortCol` / `onAcctSortSelectChange` set `frozenSortOrder = null`)
- New accounts not in the frozen list appear at the bottom

### Splash Screen
- Fires on every page load/refresh (no sessionStorage gate — JS tab switching never reloads so no risk of retrigger)
- 200px logo, 3.2s display, 0.5s fade
- Radial gradient dark bg, red pulse glow on logo, sheen animation
- Title "Account Intelligence" + subtitle "IBISWorld · US Major Markets" + animated 3-dot loader

### Workables Tab Features (renamed from Opportunities in v23)
- Tab label: **🎯 Workables** everywhere (HTML, JS, CSS)
- Parses SF contact CSV: `First Name` + `Last Name` → `name`, `Title`, `Mailing Country` → `country`, `Email`, `Account Name`, `Last Activity` (not "Last Activity Date"). No Phone column.
- Unique key = email (lowercase trimmed); stored in `ibis_opps`
- **Merge logic**: additive only — new email → add as Introduction; existing → update SF fields, preserve stage/notes/nextAction/sfOpp/sfAmt/closeDate. No auto-archive on re-upload.
- **Manual delete**: 🗑 button on each card and table row (confirm prompt before delete)
- **Toast on upload**: "✅ N updated · N new"
- **Cards view** (default, renamed from Kanban): 5 columns matching new stages
- **Table view**: full column set (see below)
- **Cold Workables** collapsible section: contacts where `archived=true`
- **Stats bar**: Total in Pipeline, stage count chips, Avg Days Inactive
- `isInTerritory(opp)` — checks if `opp.accountName` matches any account in `accounts[]` via `normName()`. Green dot shown in first table column and top-right of cards for territory matches.

#### Workables Stages (v23)
`OPP_STAGES`: 🟡 Introduction · 🔵 Walkthrough · 🟢 Proposal · 🟠 Stalled · 🔴 Lost · 🔮 Future Revisit
- Custom colored bubble dropdown (`renderStageSelect` / `toggleStageMenu` / `selectStageOpt`) — same quality as license badges
- Stage migration: old stage values auto-migrated to Introduction on `renderOpps()`
- `STAGE_COLORS` map `{stage: {bg, color}}` for consistent coloring

#### Workables Next Actions (v23)
`OPP_NEXT_ACTIONS`: 🌐 Webinar · 📧 Email Reconnect · 📋 Send Information · 📅 Book Webinar · — (grey dash)
- Native `<select>` styled with `.opp-next-select` / `.opp-next-empty`

#### Workables Table Columns (left → right)
Territory dot | Company+Logo | Name | Title | Opp | Stage | Next Action | Next Date | Close Date | Last Activity | 🗑

#### Opp Widget (v23)
- **Off**: grey dot (`.opp-dot-btn` / `.opp-dot`)
- **On**: blue pill "Opp" + `$` amount input + Close Date input, grouped as `.opp-active-wrap` with `box-shadow` glow
- `sfOpp` boolean + `sfAmt` string + `closeDate` string stored per contact
- `saveOppAmt()` auto-formats with `$` prefix; Enter key blurs input

#### Logo system for Workables
- `oppLogoHTML(opp, size)` — checks `accounts[]` first, then `ibis_local` keys, then `LOGO_DOMAIN_OVERRIDES`, then `guessDomain()`
- `guessDomain()` improved: detects non-profit/gov keywords → uses `.org` TLD; strips more noise words
- `LOGO_DOMAIN_OVERRIDES` extended with `Women's Business Development Center of Aurora → wbdc.org`, `New York SBDC Network → nysbdc.org`

### Dead Tab Features (v25)
- **Purpose:** Accounts/licenses that disappear from a re-upload CSV move here instead of silently vanishing
- **Pill view switcher** — `⚰️ Accounts` / `🗂 Licenses` buttons (not a dropdown), with live count badges
- **Resurrection:** if an account/license reappears in a future CSV upload, it's removed from dead and returns to the live tab
- **Dead accounts detection:** fires in `handleCSV()` when accounts already loaded — compares incoming names against current `accounts[]`; anything absent → pushed to `deadAccounts[]`
- **Dead licenses detection:** fires in `handleLicenseCSV()` similarly — missing license rows (matched by account name + license name) → pushed to `deadLicenses[]`
- **⚠️ Unexpected drop warning:** accounts that died WITHOUT being marked as `drop` status get an orange ⚠️ flag and sort to top of the table — these are accounts that left your territory unexpectedly
- **Status key note:** `_unexpectedDrop` is re-derived live in render as `statusKey !== 'drop'` — fixing any historical records that stored the wrong value
- **Dead accounts columns:** ⚠️ | Status | Company | Vertical | Tier | Revenue | Score | Intent | Stage | Days Inactive | Dead Since (mirrors live Accounts table)
- **Storage:** `ibis_dead` localStorage key → `{ accounts: [...], licenses: [...] }`. Each dead account carries: `_deadSince` (ISO date), `_statusAtDeath` (raw key string), `_unexpectedDrop` (bool), `_localSnapshot` (copy of ibis_local entry at time of death)
- **State vars** (declared at global scope alongside other state, line ~1469): `let deadAccounts = [], deadLicenses = [], deadView = 'accounts'`
- **Key functions:** `saveDead()`, `loadDead()`, `updateDeadTabBadge()`, `renderDead()`, `renderDeadAccounts()`, `renderDeadLicenses()`, `setDeadView(v)`
- **Section IDs:** `dead-accts-section` and `dead-lics-section` — explicit IDs used for show/hide (NOT fragile querySelectorAll indexing)

### License Intelligence Tab Features
- Parses SF "Account with Licenses & Products" CSV (~1,082 rows)
- Auto-decodes license type from License Name field:
  - 🟡 US Industry (`- US -`)
  - 🔵 PIQ / US Procurement (`- USP -` or PIQ)
  - 🟢 International (`- AU -`, `- UK -`, etc.)
  - 🟣 Trial (contains "Trial")
  - ⚫ Migration → **always hidden** ($0 junk rows)
- Status bucketing by License End Date vs today:
  - ✅ Active (end date in future)
  - 🔥 New Churn (churned 2024+) — amber badge
  - ❌ Churned (2020–2023) — red badge
  - · Dead (pre-2020) — greyed out
- Sortable columns (bidirectional toggle on all column headers)
- Checkbox filter dropdowns on Type and Status column headers (AND logic, active state highlights header)
- Stats bar recalculates live from filtered/visible rows
- Company logos: UpLead → DuckDuckGo → Google → Initials (same cascade as Accounts tab)

## FRONTEND DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
*Applies to all UI work only — does not govern backend logic, CSV parsing, or data handling.*

- **This is a sales tool used in client-facing meetings** — it must impress, not just function. Every visual decision should hold up under a VP's gaze on a shared screen.
- **Avoid all generic AI UI patterns** — no default box shadows, no Bootstrap energy, no cookie-cutter card layouts. If it looks like it came from a template, it's wrong.
- **Animations must feel intentional and premium** — never decorative. Every transition should serve a purpose: confirming an action, guiding the eye, or communicating state. No animation for animation's sake.
- **Every component must match the existing design language exactly** — DM Sans + DM Mono, IBISWorld red `#C8102E`, light theme `#f0f2f5`, the tier diamond system, the vertical color palette. New components must feel like they were always there.
- **Think like a designer AND an engineer simultaneously** — visual quality and code quality are equally non-negotiable. A feature that works but looks wrong is not done.
- **Reference the frontend-design skill** at `/mnt/skills/public/frontend-design/SKILL.md` when building or modifying any UI component.
- **Information hierarchy first** — before writing a single line of CSS, ask: what does the user need to see first? Design the visual weight to match that answer.
- **Progressive disclosure over information overload** — show the most important data always; let the rest live one interaction away. Don't cram everything into a card.

## CSV SCHEMAS

### Accounts CSV (SF "DA$ Account Stalker" report)
IBISWorld Custom Report Title, # Core Clients, # Core Opportunities,
US Days Since Last Activity, Account Name, Website, Major Markets Tier,
Vertical, Sub-Vertical, Employees, Annual Revenue Currency, Annual Revenue,
6sense Account Intent Score NA, 6sense Account Buying Stage NA

### License CSV (SF "Account with Licenses & Products" report)
Account Name, License Name, Opportunity Name,
Annualized Amount Currency, Annualized Amount,
License Start Date, License End Date

---

## BUSINESS LOGIC — CRITICAL
- IBISWorld does **NOT** sell by seat count
- In Dan's territory, active licenses are always **PIQ or International** — never US Industry
- **US Industry = churn signal**, not active client
- The Salesforce "Active License" field is **unreliable** — always use License End Date comparison vs today
- Account name matching uses case-insensitive trim (`normName()`)

### Territory Rules — applied via `applyLicenseRules(lic)` at parse + restore time:

1. **Active US Industry → PIQ**: If `_type === 'US'` AND `_active === true`, reclassify to PIQ. No active US Industry clients exist in Dan's territory — these are actually US Procurement accounts.
2. **Churned US trial → TRIAL**: If `_type === 'US'` AND `_active === false` AND `_acv === 0` AND Opportunity Name contains "trial", reclassify to TRIAL. These are $0 churned US Industry rows that are actually expired trials.

---

## SORT / FILTER PATTERN — ESTABLISHED CONVENTION
Both tabs implement sort state independently. Follow this pattern for any future tab:

### State variables (declare near top of JS, near existing `licSortCol`)
```javascript
let fooSortCol = 'someDefault';
let fooSortDir = 'desc';
const FOO_SORT_DEFAULT_DIR = { col1:'asc', col2:'desc' }; // sensible default per column
```

### Toggle function (click on column header → toggles direction; new column → reset to default)
```javascript
function setFooSortCol(col) {
  if (fooSortCol === col) { fooSortDir = fooSortDir === 'asc' ? 'desc' : 'asc'; }
  else { fooSortCol = col; fooSortDir = FOO_SORT_DEFAULT_DIR[col] || 'desc'; }
  saveSortPref(); renderFoo();
}
```

### Persistence — `saveSortPref()` and `restoreSortPref()` write to `ibis_sort` (JSON, keyed by tab name)
- Add `prefs.foo = { col: fooSortCol, dir: fooSortDir }` in `saveSortPref`
- Restore in `restoreSortPref` similarly

### Sort arrows — `updateFooSortArrows()` sets `▲` / `▼` on active header; clears others
- Each `<th>` gets `<span class="acct-sort-arrow" id="fsort-colname"></span>`
- Function mirrors `updateAcctSortArrows()` / `updateLicSortArrows()` pattern

### Full `TableControls` refactor is deferred until a 3rd tab is built.

## OUTREACH EXTENSION — Chrome Extension

**Location:** `/outreach-extension/` subfolder inside this repo (saved to GitHub, not deployed)
**Version:** v2.0.0
**Purpose:** Priority-based contact engine + email history layer on top of Outlook Web — companion to the dashboard

### Files
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `manifest.json` | MV3. Runs on all Outlook URL variants + dabbs4dan.github.io |
| `content.js` | Injects collapsible sidebar into Outlook. Reads contacts from `chrome.storage.local` |
| `sidebar.css` | All sidebar styles. DM Sans/Mono, #C8102E, #f0f2f5 — matches dashboard exactly |
| `background.js` | Service worker. Generates red "I" icon via OffscreenCanvas. Relays refresh messages to bridge.js |
| `bridge.js` | Content script injected into dashboard page. Reads `ibis_opps` from localStorage → writes to `chrome.storage.local` as `outreach_contacts_raw` |

### How data flows
1. User opens dashboard → `bridge.js` auto-pushes `ibis_opps` into `chrome.storage.local.outreach_contacts_raw`
2. User opens Outlook → `content.js` reads `outreach_contacts_raw` → parses + displays contacts
3. Refresh button → asks `background.js` → finds open dashboard tab → tells `bridge.js` to re-push
4. CSV upload in dashboard → `bridge.js` detects `storage` event → auto-pushes updated data

### Storage keys (chrome.storage.local)
- `outreach_contacts_raw` — raw `ibis_opps` JSON string, written by bridge.js
- `outreach_contacts_ts` — timestamp of last push
- `ibis_sidebar_collapsed` — sidebar open/closed state
- `ibis_badge_top` — vertical position of the collapse badge

### Sidebar UI
- 300px right-anchored sidebar, IBISWorld red header
- 3 campaign cards: 🎯 Workables · 🔄 Winbacks · 📋 Samples
- 🎯 Workables: populated from `ibis_opps` — filters out `archived=true` and `stage='Lost'`
- Contact rows: letter avatar (color by initial) · Name · Company · stage pill (dashboard colors)
- Click contact → navigates Outlook to `from:[email]` search
- Collapse badge: small red "I" square, pinned to right wall, drag up/down only
- 🔄 refresh button in header — re-syncs from dashboard tab if open

### Manifest URL patterns (all Outlook variants covered)
- `https://outlook.live.com/*`
- `https://outlook.office.com/*`
- `https://outlook.office365.com/*`
- `https://outlook.cloud.microsoft/*` ← Microsoft's new URL (important)
- `https://outlook.microsoft.com/*`

### How to reload after code changes
1. Edit files locally
2. `chrome://extensions` → IBISWorld Outreach → click ↺ reload
3. Hard refresh Outlook tab (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. **Do NOT just reload the tab** — must reload the extension first

### How to install fresh
1. `chrome://extensions` → Enable Developer mode
2. Load unpacked → select `outreach-extension/` folder
3. Open dashboard once (so bridge.js pushes contact data)
4. Open Outlook — sidebar appears automatically

### Design rules (same as dashboard)
- Font: DM Sans + DM Mono (Google Fonts)
- Red: `#C8102E`
- Background: `#f0f2f5`
- Stage pill colors match dashboard `STAGE_COLORS` exactly
- No shadows on the collapse badge

## EMAIL DATA LAYER — ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES

The Priority Engine in the Outreach Extension needs email contact history (last sent, last received, thread status) per contact. This data could come from multiple sources depending on what's available.

### Design rule: swappable data source
**The extension must never be tightly coupled to any single data source.** Email history is written to a standardized JSON format in `chrome.storage.local` under `outreach_email_cache`. Any source can write to this key — the Priority Engine reads from it the same way regardless of origin.

### Standardized email cache format
```json
{
  "email@domain.com": {
    "lastSent":    "2026-03-20T14:00:00Z",
    "lastReceived": "2026-03-22T09:00:00Z",
    "lastSubject": "Re: IBISWorld demo",
    "source":      "powerautomate",
    "ts":          1742000000000
  }
}
```
The `source` field documents where the data came from. The Priority Engine only reads `lastSent`, `lastReceived`, `lastSubject`.

### Data source priority chain (fallback order)
1. **Power Automate sync** (`source: "powerautomate"`) — Flow reads Outlook sent+inbox, writes JSON to OneDrive, extension fetches it on load. Best coverage, fully passive. ⚠️ Tied to IBISWorld M365 account — if Dan leaves IBISWorld, this source disappears.
2. **MutationObserver cache** (`source: "dom_observer"`) — Passively captures emails as Dan browses Outlook naturally. Builds up over time. Works on any machine with the extension installed.
3. **Click-triggered DOM scrape** (`source: "dom_click"`) — On-demand capture when Dan opens a contact's thread from the sidebar. Zero setup, zero dependencies, works anywhere.
4. **No data** — Priority Engine degrades gracefully: all contacts default to `email_today` bucket until cache populates.

### ⚠️ Power Automate portability warning
Power Automate is available because Dan is employed at IBISWorld. **If Dan leaves IBISWorld:** source 1 disappears entirely. Sources 2 + 3 continue working on any new employer's Outlook setup with no changes needed. The extension is designed so sources 2+3 alone produce a usable (if slower-to-populate) Priority Engine.

### Future alternative sources (drop-in replacements for source 1)
- **IMAP bridge** — small local script (Python/Node) that reads via IMAP and writes the same JSON format to a shared file
- **Azure AD app** — if IT registers a custom app with Mail.Read, the extension can call Graph directly
- **Other automation tools** — Zapier, Make.com, n8n — any tool that can read Outlook and write a JSON file to a URL the extension can fetch

## HOW TO WORK WITH DAN

### Who Dan is
- Non-technical vibe coder — explain everything in plain English, no jargon
- Visual thinker — use emojis, tables, short bullets, never walls of text
- Moves fast — values speed and iteration over perfection

### How to communicate
- Before ANY change: one sentence explaining what you're about to do and why
- After ANY change: bullet list of exactly what changed, confirmed push, and what's next
- If something is broken or risky: flag it immediately with 🚨 before touching anything
- Max one logical change group at a time — always pause and summarize before moving on

### How to handle bugs & polish
- Small bugs and style fixes: just fix them, explain after, then push
- Anything that touches core logic or adds a new feature: propose a plan first, wait for Dan to say "go"
- If you're unsure what Dan wants: ask ONE specific question before proceeding

### Git workflow
- Always commit and push after every completed task
- Commit messages should be short and plain English (not technical)
- Always confirm: commit hash + "live in ~30 seconds"

### Vibe check
- Dan should always feel like he knows what's happening
- If the dashboard looks worse after a change, that's a failure — visual quality always matters
- When in doubt: simpler, cleaner, faster

## SLASH COMMANDS
Three commands live in `.claude/commands/` — type them anytime in Claude Code:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/start-session` | Reads CLAUDE.md, prints version + last build + open items, asks what to tackle |
| `/check-session` | Health check — exchange count, uncommitted changes, unfinished tasks, recommendation |
| `/end-session` | Commits anything loose, confirms CLAUDE.md is current, prints safe-to-close summary |

---

## SESSION & CONTEXT MANAGEMENT

### Starting fresh — do this first
When a new session begins, Claude Code should:
1. Read CLAUDE.md fully
2. Confirm in one line: current version, last thing built, next open item
3. Ask Dan: "What do you want to tackle?"
- Never assume Dan remembers where things left off — he shouldn't have to

### Context window health
- After ~15 back-and-forth exchanges, say proactively:
  > 🧠 "Heads up — this session is getting long. Type `/compact` to compress history, or start a fresh window. CLAUDE.md has everything needed to pick up instantly."
- If responses feel repetitive or confused, flag it immediately — don't silently degrade

### Before closing a window — always confirm
- ✅ All changes committed and pushed to main
- ✅ CLAUDE.md reflects current state of the codebase
- ✅ Any unfinished work is noted below under Open Items

## OPEN ITEMS

| Priority | Item | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ Done | Licenses count on Accounts | Shown in card stat (replaces Clients) + table column, sortable. Uses `getLicCount(name)` via `normName()` matching. |
| ✅ Done | License badges on Account rows | `.alb-piq`, `.alb-intl`, `.alb-churn`, `.alb-trial` on cards + table. `getLicBadgeSpans()` / `getLicBadgesForAccount()`. |
| ✅ Done | Stale `ibis_local` cleanup | `stampLastSeen()` + `pruneStaleLocalData()` on CSV upload. Prunes entries not seen in >180 days with no notes/flags. |
| ✅ Done | Sort state persistence | Saved to `ibis_sort` key; restored on init via `restoreSortPref()`. |
| ✅ Done | Storage warning banner | Shows amber banner when any key >2MB or total >4MB; Clear Cache button strips only rev data. |
| ✅ Done | Update Claude model ID | Updated to `claude-sonnet-4-6`. |
| ✅ Done | Shared sort/filter pattern | Documented above under SORT / FILTER PATTERN. Full `TableControls` refactor deferred to 3rd tab. |
| ✅ Done | Wikipedia company descriptions | 5-step cascade: direct → suffix-stripped → slash-parts → Wikidata entity search → Wikipedia Search API. DESC_VERSION=6. 4-layer quality gate: `NON_BUSINESS_TERMS` + `isJustCompanyName` + `isGenericIndustryLabel` + `hasBusinessSignal` (positive require). `clearStaleDescs()` wipes old-version cache on load before first render. Claude revenue call also returns `description` field — highest quality, overwrites Wikipedia/Wikidata. |
| ✅ Done | 📌 Latest US filter chip | Licenses tab — deduplicates to 1 US Industry row per account (latest end date). Clears type/status filters on activate; those filters deactivate it. |
| ✅ Done | Lost renewal rule (Rule 0) | `applyLicenseRules`: `$0 + US + "renewal" in opp` → forces `_active=false`, `_churnTier=newchurn`. Prevents false PIQ promotion. Shown as US Industry. |
| ✅ Done | Logo flicker fix v2 | `logoResolved{}` cache — once a domain's URL resolves, stored in memory. Re-renders use cached URL at opacity:1 instantly. All three logo render sites (cards, accounts table, licenses table) check cache first. |
| ✅ Done | Opportunities tab (v22) | Kanban + Table view, drag-and-drop, CSV merge (add/update/archive), Cold section, stats bar. `ibis_opps` key. `setMainView()` refactored to 3-tab loop. |
| ✅ Done | Workables tab v23 overhaul | Renamed from Opportunities. New SF CSV schema (First/Last Name, Mailing Country, Last Activity). Additive merge only. Territory dot. Close date field. 6 stages incl. Future Revisit. Next Action emoji dropdown. Opp widget (dot → pill+amt+closedate). |
| ✅ Done | Accounts table v23 overhaul | Status column (Keep/Monitor/Drop portal dropdown). Workables column. US Client column. Active Client column. Tier multi-select filter. New filter chips (Keep/Monitor/Drop/Active License). Row click modal removed. Frozen sort order. |
| ✅ Done | Status dropdown portal | `#acct-status-portal` at body level, z-index:9500. Fixes table stacking context click-through permanently. `applyPortalStatus()` reverse-maps safeId → account name. Closes on scroll + click-outside. |
| ✅ Done | Frozen sort order | `frozenSortOrder[]` locks row order after explicit sort. Background enrichment + status changes never reshuffle rows. Clears only on explicit header click. |
| ✅ Done | acctStatus prune protection | `pruneStaleLocalData` now treats `acctStatus` as user data — won't prune an entry that has a Keep/Monitor/Drop set. |
| ✅ Done | Sentiment Score v24 | Weighted 1–10 composite score per account. Wikipedia + Wikidata + internal data. Battle card popover with factor breakdown. No paid API needed. `SENT_VERSION=1`. |
| ✅ Done | Dead tab v25 | Accounts/licenses missing from re-upload CSV move here. Pill view switcher. ⚠️ unexpected drop flag (clickable to dismiss). Column parity with live accounts table. Resurrection on re-upload. `ibis_dead` key. Account death auto-moves its licenses to dead. |
| ✅ Done | Priority column v26 | Rarity-tier dropdown (💎 Legendary → 🪵 Common) via portal pattern. Stored in `ibis_local[name].acctPriority`. Filter chips in top bar. Sortable. Status column now collapsible to 28px strip with visible expand button. |
| ✅ Done | Stage filter + OR chip logic v26 | Stage badges in table + card are clickable to filter; active badge shows outline ring. Filter chips use OR-within-group / AND-between-group: Legendary+Very Rare shows either; Keep+Legendary shows intersection. `toggleStageFilter()` + group-aware filter logic in `renderAll()`. |
| ⚠️ Monitor | Description quality | DESC_VERSION=6. ~85% high quality. A few accounts may show vertical-tag fallback until Claude revenue enrichment runs. |
| ⚠️ Monitor | Sentiment score tuning | Score weights and thresholds may need adjustment after real-world use. Headline auto-generation covers ~10 scenarios. |
| 🗺️ Future | Cloudflare Worker proxy | `cloudflare-worker.js` ready in repo. Would unlock Claude API enrichment for higher-quality revenue, descriptions, and AI-powered sentiment from live site. |
| 🗺️ Future | Workables filter chips | Active Workables, Active Opportunities, Lost, Stalled filter chips — spec agreed but not yet built. |
| 🗺️ Future | Workables controls bar | Search field positioning, filter chip styling to match Licenses tab controls bar. |
| 🗺️ Future | Workables sort persistence | Sort state for Workables table not yet saved to `ibis_sort`. |
| 🗺️ Future | Opp dollar auto-format | Format sfAmt as currency on blur ($ prefix, comma separation). |
| 🗺️ Future | Licenses dropdown overflow | Type/Status filter dropdowns get clipped when only 1–2 rows showing. Needs position:fixed dropdown. |
| 🗺️ Future | Mobile/responsive layout | No media queries exist. |
| 🗺️ Future | Meetings layer | SF "Activities with Accounts" report |
| 🗺️ Future | Tasks/Samples layer | SF "Tasks and Events" report |
| ✅ Done | Outreach Extension foundation | `/outreach-extension/` — MV3 Chrome extension. Sidebar on Outlook with 3 campaign cards. Collapse badge (red "I", right-wall pinned, vertical drag). SPA resilience + context invalidation guards. |
| ✅ Done | Outreach Extension: Workables sync | `bridge.js` on dashboard pushes `ibis_opps` → `chrome.storage.local`. 3s poll fixes same-window CSV upload detection (storage event only fires cross-tab). |
| ✅ Done | Outreach Extension: search fix | `navigateToContact` now uses `window.open(..., '_blank')` to open search in new tab — avoids breaking the cloud.microsoft SPA. |
| ✅ Done | Outreach Extension v2.0: Priority Engine | Full rewrite. `config.js` for all settings. 3-view sidebar: Home → Contact List → Thread View. CORS fix: all email fetches route through background service worker. `allWorkables` (non-archived incl. Lost) used for Workables campaign count; `allContacts` (non-Lost) for Priority Engine. Diagnostic panel with token scope display. |
| ✅ Done | Outreach Extension: Workables campaign fix | `allWorkables` array tracks all non-archived contacts (including Lost stage). Workables campaign card shows correct full count. Contact row clicks use correct pool (allWorkables vs allContacts). |
| 🔥 BLOCKED | Outreach Extension: direct email API | IBISWorld tenant blocks all mail API paths — confirmed. Graph token scp = `openid profile user.read` only. All 5 approaches (OWA cloud.microsoft, OWA office365, Graph me/messages, Graph search/query, OWA Bearer) return 403/HTML. **Workaround path chosen: Power Automate → SF Activities → OneDrive JSON** (see below). Direct API unblocking requires IT (Azure AD app reg with Mail.Read). |
| 🔴 Next | Outreach Extension: PA flow + extension wiring | Build `IBISWorld Contact Activity Sync` PA flow: recurrence trigger (every 2h) → Salesforce Get Records (Tasks, filter by WhoId populated) → compose `contact_activity.json` (one entry per contact email: lastSent, lastReceived, lastSubject, source:"powerautomate") → OneDrive Create/Update file in `IBISWorld Outreach/contact_activity.json`. Then update `config.js` with OneDrive share URL + update `content.js` to fetch + parse into `outreach_email_cache`. Export flow as zip → `/powerautomate-flows/contact-activity-sync.zip` in repo. |
| ⚠️ Monitor | Outreach Extension: contact count | Workables card shows 0 until dashboard opened once (bridge.js pushes ibis_opps on load). |
| 🗺️ Future | Outreach Extension: DOM scraper fallback | If Azure AD app registration isn't possible, build `scraper.js` content script that reads email list from Outlook DOM when user opens thread view. No API needed — reads rendered rows. Triggered on-click only (not background scan). |
| 🗺️ Future | Outreach Extension: Winbacks campaign | Define filter logic (churned accounts, lost stage contacts) + populate from ibis_opps/ibis_licenses |
| 🗺️ Future | Outreach Extension: Samples campaign | Define filter logic + contact list |
| 🗺️ Future | Outreach Extension: Add Campaign modal | UI + storage for custom campaigns |
| 🗺️ Future | Outreach Extension: email compose integration | Pre-fill Outlook compose with contact name + template on click |
| 🗺️ Future | Outreach Extension: activity logging | Log sent emails back to dashboard (surface in Workables tab) |
